AWS project on "How to create a crud serverless api gateway using AWS dynamodb, AWS lambda, AWS gateway"


-> create a dynamodb table with name product-inventory and the primary key as product id
-> next navigate to IAM to create a role, click on roles and then create role then choose the use case as lambda.
   Now click on next to add the permissions to it which are
	1)dynamodb full access
	2)cloudwatch full access
   now click on next to add name to the role which is "serverless-api-role" and then click on create. Now we can move on to create a lambda
   function for api code
-> navigate to lambda and then create function then the function name is "serverless-api-lambda" and then select the language as python 
   since you are doing it in python language so i am selecting "python 3.9". Under the permissions section we use the role we just created
   and then click on create function. in the configurations below change the timeout from 3 secs to 1 min and if you are having large date 
   then increase the data from 128mb to 500mb or else leave it alone and click on save. 
-> Now it's time to create the api gateway to connect everything, navigate to api gateway in that select the rest api but not the rest api
   private, then click on build and then give the api name as "severless-api" and then hit the create button. Now we are now going to 
   create some resources. hit on create resource give a resource name as "health" and then create it. and then repeat it with name as 
   "product" which will do operations for single product and then we create the resourse "products" which will do operations on multiple 
   products. 
-> Now select the health resourse under which we will create get method to check if the api is healthy or not. Under which we will select
   the method type as get and also check the lambda proxy integration and also choose the lambda function we created earlier. Under the 
   product resource we will have a get method where we will have a single product leave the remaining changes as above. under the product 
   section itself create a post method which will insert into the database. next is the patch method under the product resource where we
   will want to modify a single item. finally we are going to have a delete method under the product resource where we want to delete an
   item from the database. Now coming to products path where we are going to use get method where we want all the products from our database
   and the configuration of our api is done now it's our time to deploy that, hit on that deploy button and then create a new stage with 
   name "prod" and then deploy it. 
-> Now its time to write the code in lambda section of the AWS go to the code part and then in the lambda_function.py write the code :



import boto3
import json
from custom_encoder import CustomEncoder
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

dynamodbTableName = 'product-inventory'
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table(dynamodbTableName)

getMethod = 'GET'
postMethod = 'POST'
patchMethod = 'PATCH'
deleteMethod = 'DELETE'
healthPath = '/health'
productPath = '/product'
productsPath = '/products'

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    logger.info(event)
    
    httpMethod = event['httpMethod']
    path = event['path']
    
    try:
        if httpMethod == getMethod and path == healthPath:
            response = buildResponse(200)
        elif httpMethod == getMethod and path == productPath:
            response = getProduct(event['queryStringParameters']['productid'])
        elif httpMethod == getMethod and path == productsPath:
            response = getProducts()
        elif httpMethod == postMethod and path == productPath:
            response = saveProduct(json.loads(event['body']))
        elif httpMethod == patchMethod and path == productPath:
            requestBody = json.loads(event['body'])
            response = modifyProduct(requestBody['productid'], requestBody['updateKey'], requestBody['updateValue'])
        elif httpMethod == deleteMethod and path == productPath:
            requestBody = json.loads(event['body'])
            response = deleteProduct(requestBody['productid'])
        else:
            response = buildResponse(404, 'Not Found')
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception('Unhandled exception.')
        response = buildResponse(500, {'Message': 'Internal Server Error', 'Error': str(e)})
    
    return response

def getProduct(productid):
    try:
        response = table.get_item(Key={'productid': productid})
        if 'Item' in response:
            return buildResponse(200, response['Item'])
        else:
            return buildResponse(404, {'Message': f'Productid: {productid} not found'})
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception('Error getting product.')
        return buildResponse(500, {'Message': 'Error getting product', 'Error': str(e)})

def getProducts():
    try:
        response = table.scan()
        result = response['Items']
        
        while 'LastEvaluatedKey' in response:
            response = table.scan(ExclusiveStartKey=response['LastEvaluatedKey'])
            result.extend(response['Items'])
            
        body = {'Products': result}
        return buildResponse(200, body)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception('Error getting products.')
        return buildResponse(500, {'Message': 'Error getting products', 'Error': str(e)})

def saveProduct(requestBody):
    try:
        table.put_item(Item=requestBody)
        body = {
            'Operation': 'SAVE',
            'Message': 'SUCCESS',
            'Item': requestBody
        }
        return buildResponse(200, body)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception('Error saving product.')
        return buildResponse(500, {'Message': 'Error saving product', 'Error': str(e)})

def modifyProduct(productid, updateKey, updateValue):
    try:
        response = table.update_item(
            Key={'Productid': productid},
            UpdateExpression=f'set {updateKey} = :value',
            ExpressionAttributeValues={':value': updateValue},
            ReturnValues='UPDATED_NEW'
        )
        body = {
            'Operation': 'UPDATE',
            'Message': 'SUCCESS',
            'UpdatedAttributes': response
        }
        return buildResponse(200, body)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception('Error modifying product.')
        return buildResponse(500, {'Message': 'Error modifying product', 'Error': str(e)})

def deleteProduct(productid):
    try:
        response = table.delete_item(
            Key={'productid': productid},
            ReturnValues='ALL_OLD'
        )
        body = {
            'Operation': 'DELETE',
            'Message': 'SUCCESS',
            'DeletedItem': response
        }
        return buildResponse(200, body)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception('Error deleting product.')
        return buildResponse(500, {'Message': 'Error deleting product', 'Error': str(e)})

def buildResponse(statusCode, body=None):
    response = {
        'statusCode': statusCode,
        'headers': {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
        }
    }
    if body is not None:
        response['body'] = json.dumps(body, cls=CustomEncoder)
    return response

-> Now create another file in the same way with name custom_encoder.py and write the code :


import json

from decimal import Decimal

class CustomEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    def default(self, obj):
        if isinstance(obj, Decimal):
            return float(obj)
        
        return json.JSONEncoder.default(self, obj)

-> Hit the deploy option and then go to postman and check for the gateway's health and if the products are adding, deleting, updating, or if you can go through all the products available or not I'm pretty confident that you can find your self succefull using the above provided.
